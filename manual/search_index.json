We need\nto give it some.\nWriting some data\nSequins works by asynchronously mirroring data at rest in HDFS, S3, or another\nfilesystem. It's particularly suited for ingesting data written from\nHadoop or similar tools.\nYou'll want to write a job that dumps out some key/value-oriented data in the\nSequenceFile format. This is a commonly-used format in the\nHadoop ecosystem, so tools like Pig, Scalding or Spark should all be able to\nwrite it out of the box. More info on the supported formats can be found in the\nData Requirements section.\nOnce you have your data ready, you need to arrange it in a particular way in\nS3, HDFS, or on local disk2:\n/path/to/data\n└── mydata\n    └── version0\n        ├── part-00000  # These names are irrelevant, but this is how Hadoop\n        ├── part-00001  # names files.\n        ├── part-00002\n        └── ...\nmydata is a name for your dataset, which we'll henceforth call a database.\nversion0 is the version of the database; that comes into play when we want\nto update it. Both are arbitrary strings.\nOnce your data is written, tell sequins to reload the data by HUPing it:\n$ pkill -HUP -f sequins\nSequins should start automatically  downloading and mirroring your data. If it's\na large dataset, this can take a while. (If it's a really big dataset, you'll\nwant to read about sharding over multiple\nmachines.)\nYou can check the progress by opening http://localhost:9599 in a browser, or\nsimply watching the logs.\nQuerying it\nOnce your data is finished loading, you can query it by issuing an HTTP GET to\n//:\n$ http localhost:9599//\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 7\nDate: Mon, 01 Aug 2016 11:57:53 GMT\nLast-Modified: Mon, 01 Aug 2016 11:56:27 GMT\nX-Sequins-Version: version0\n\n\nNote: The database names healthz and healthcheck cannot be used as they\nare reserved for the healthcheck endpoints.\nFurther Configuration\nSequins usually reads its config from a configuration file called\nsequins.conf, either in the local directory or at /etc/sequins.conf.\nThe release tarballs contain a sequins.conf.example, which you can copy and\nmodify as you please; you can also check out the Configuration\nReference for more details.\n\n1. You may need S3 credentials in your environment or in a config file. See the Configuration Reference. ↩\n\n\n2. Yes, S3 doesn't have directories. We do our best to pretend that it does, though.

When sequins starts up, and whenever it is told to refresh its local data,\nit will do its best to mirror the organizational structure of the source root.\nThis source root can be on local disk, HDFS, or Amazon S3. You can\nset it be setting the source root\nconfiguration property to a URI:\n\nData in local disk can be referred to by just the path, or with a file://\nURI:\n file:///path/to/data\n\n\n\nData in HDFS can be referred to with an hdfs:// URI, using the namenode\naddress and port as the hostname:\n hdfs://namenode:8020/path/to/data\n\n\n\nData in S3 can be referred to by an s3:// URI, using the bucket name as\nthe host:\n s3://my-bucket/path/to/data\n\n\nIn the later case, the \"path\" is really a key prefix; S3 does not have real\ndirectories. Sequins treats prefix components separated by / as directories,\njust like awscli or other tools.\nUnder the source root, the data should be organized into databases and below\nthat into versions:\n/path/to/data\n├── \n│   ├── \n│   │   ├── \n│   │   ├── \n│   │   ├── \n│   │   └── ...\n│   └── \n│       └── ...\n└── \n    └── \n        └── ...\nBoth the database and version can be arbitrary strings, but URI-friendly strings\nare recommended.\nDatabases and Versions\nA single sequins instance can hold multiple databases. This is the first layer of\ndirectories in the source root.\nSequins doesn't support individual writes, like other object stores would.\nInstead, databases are versioned. To update a database, you present it with an\nentirely new copy of the dataset, called a version, by dropping it into the\ndatabase folder in the source root.\nDatabase and version names must consist of alphanumeric characters,\nhyphens, and underscores (path components are ignored if they include\nother characters). But otherwise, they are just arbitrary strings, and\nare compared lexicographically - so to update a database, you need to\ngive it a version that is lexicographically greater than the current\none. At Stripe we use date +%Y%m%d (eg 20160901) and timestamps.\nSequins will load this in the background and hotswap it in atomically.\nAdditionally, Sequins returns an X-Sequins-Version header on\nresponses if\nyou need to track what version you're getting.\nLoading New Data\nYou can tell sequins to check for new data in two ways. The first is the\nrefresh_period\nconfiguration property, which instructs sequins to continually check for new\ndata. You can also send a SIGHUP to the process and it will reload a single\ntime.\nEither way, sequins will perform three operations:\n\nFor any new databases that weren't there before, load the latest version and\nstart serving it.\n\nFor each database which is no longer in the source root, stop serving it and\ndelete it locally.\n\nFor each existing database, load whichever version is lexicographically\ngreatest, if it is not the current local version.\n\n\n"},"1-2-data-requirements/":{"url":"1-2-data-requirements/","title":"Data Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Data Requirements\nCurrently Sequins supports two input file formats:\n\nSequenceFiles\nSparkey files\n\nThere are also a few guidelines for producing data for sequins.\nSequenceFiles\nThe default input format for Sequins is SequenceFiles. These are\ntypically generated by Hadoop Map/Reduce.\nNaming\nSequins doesn't care at all how your SequenceFiles are named, but will ingest\nany files in a version directory.\nCompression\nYou can use either BLOCK or RECORD compression for SequenceFiles, or leave\nthem uncompressed. Both snappy and gzip are supported.\nSharding\nSequins uses a sharding algorithm in which keys are\nbucketed into N partitions, where the number of partitions is the number of\nfiles in the dataset. To do this, it uses a hash function based on Java's String\nhashCode function, chosen because it aligns coincidentally with the way Hadoop\noften buckets keys into reducers.\nIn practice, this means that if your Hadoop job outputting the data has a reduce\nstep, and the key is a String, and has the same value as the output key,\nthen your data is effectively pre-sharded when it's written out, and each\nindividual sequins instance can just download the data it needs, than rather\nscanning everything and downloading just the keys it wants.\nWhile this obviously isn't a hard requirement, it can make loading new data much\nfaster.\nKey and value serialization\nHadoop often writes SequenceFiles with individual key and value serializations;\nin this way, SequenceFile is generic.\nSequins supports any key and value serialization, but has some optimizations for\nthe commons ones. In particular,\norg.apache.hadoop.io.BytesWritable and\norg.apache.hadoop.io.Text are unwrapped, and the actual underlying bytes\nare used. For example, if you have a SequenceFile[BytesWritable, Text] and a\nrecord is saved as:\ncontext.write(new BytesWritable(\"foo\".getBytes(\"ASCII\")), new Text(\"bar\"))\nThen you can query the value at /mydata/foo, as you'd expect.\nHowever, with other serializations, sequins doesn't do any converting for you,\nand you'll need to consider how the data actually looks on disk. This can be a\nbit tricky. Let's say you have a SequenceFile[IntWritable, IntWritable] and\nyou write the tuple (42, 100). Hadoop serializes a IntWritable as an unsigned\nint321, so you'd need to query it as such:\n$ curl localhost:9599/mydata/%00%00%00%2A | hexdump\n0000000 00 00 00 64\n\n1. IntWritable represents a signed int, but it's cast first; so -42 would be ↩\n\n%FF%FF%FF%D6.\nSparkey files\nSequins also supports Sparkey files as an input format with faster\nloading.\nIngesting SequenceFiles is often CPU-limited, as Sequins has to read the whole\nfile and convert it to its internal storage format. This is also inefficient, as\nit has to be done on every single Sequins node, rather than once by whatever\ngenerates the data. If you provide your data in Sparkey format, Sequins can load\nyour data about ten times faster.\nFormat details\nThe input directory should contain pairs of Sparkey log files and compressed\nSparkey index files.\nThe Sparkey log files, with extension .spl, contain a list of keys and values.\nThe keys in this file should be in lexicographically-sorted order.\nThe compressed Sparkey index files, with extension .spi.sz, associates keys\nwith their locations in the log file.\nNaming\nEach log/index file pair must have the exact same basename, but with different\nextensions.\nThe name of each file must contain at least one sequence of digits. The first\nsuch run of digits must identify which key partition the file is\nfor. For example, the file part-00012-00034.spl is for partition number 12.\nIt is legal to have multiple pairs of files from the same partition, for example\nwith names part-00012-00034.spl and part-00012-00035.spl. However, such\nfiles must contain non-overlapping key ranges.\nCompression\nThe Sparkey log files must use Sparkey's built-in Snappy compression. The index\nfiles must be compressed with framed-Snappy compression.\nSharding\nEach log/index file pair must contain keys only from a single key partition.\nThis means that a file with partition number 12 should only contain a key K if\nhashCode(K) % numPartitions == 12.\nKey and value serialization\nSparkey files should contain data of type BytesWritable and Text pre-unwrapped.\nIn other words, new Text(\"foo\") should be stored as just foo.\nHowever other Writable formats such as IntWritable should be stored in their\ncanonical serialization format.\nGeneration\nWhile SequenceFiles are trivial to generate in Hadoop, it's slightly more\ncomplex to generate Sparkey files. We've provided a Sparkey-generating version\nof the Hadoop Word Count example, to help you along.\nGuidelines\nWhile not required, Sequins operates best when the number and sizes of input\nfiles are under certain thresholds.\nThe number of input files (and hence partitions) affects the stability of\nZookeeper. A maximum of 512 input files per version is a good threshold.\nInput files that are very large are more likely to hang or fail during\ndownloads. A good threshold here depends on your download speeds, but we prefer\nfiles below 5 GiB in size.\n"},"1-3-querying-sequins/":{"url":"1-3-querying-sequins/","title":"Querying Sequins","keywords":"","body":"Querying Sequins\nSequins has a single interface for fetching values, HTTP GET:\n$ http localhost:9599/mydata/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 7\nDate: Mon, 01 Aug 2016 11:57:53 GMT\nLast-Modified: Mon, 01 Aug 2016 11:56:27 GMT\nX-Sequins-Version: version0\n\n\nFor this reason, Sequins has no client library; you can use whatever HTTP client\nis available in your language.\nResponse and Request Headers\nSequins supports a couple advanced HTTP features and customizations:\n\nLast-Modified is set to the time that the database was last updated or\ncreated.\n\nContent-Length is set on responses, and you should ensure that your HTTP\nclient verifies that the response body is the correct length.\n\nX-Sequins-Version is set on responses, and holds the current version of the\ndatabase.\n\nIf the request was proxied to a peer in a distributed cluster,\n'X-Sequins-Proxied-to' will hold the hostname of the peer.\n\n\nResponse Codes\nSequins will sometimes return non-200 response codes:\n\n400 Bad Request: This is returned for requests with an HTTP method other\nthan GET, and for requests with only a single path component (and therefore\nno key), like GET /foo.\n\n404 Not Found: This indicates that either the key or database does not\nexist.

Sequins will\nautomatically and transparently divvy up and replicate your data, but this\ncomes with two important caveats:\n\nSequins sharding is static. A cluster will reshard a database once at\nstartup, and once whenever a new version is available.\n\nNew nodes will happily overreplicate partitions, but if a node disappears\nthe cluster will never automatically re-replicate partitions (you can,\nhowever, replace the node).\n\n\nSequins requires a running Zookeeper cluster for coordination, but not to\nserve requests (see Zookeeper Failure for more\ninformation on how this dependency works, and what the failure modes are).\nSetting up\nYou'll need the following properties in sequins.conf on all the nodes in the\ncluster, at a minimum:\n\nsharding.enabled: This should be set to true.\n\nzk.servers: This should be the address(es) of the zookeeper quorum, eg\n[\"zk1:2181\"]\n\n\nThere's lots of other ways to tweak your distributed setup; see the\nConfiguration Reference for details.\nThen start up the nodes. Because sharding is static, sequins will wait for the\nlist of peers to stabilize before proceeding; you should start the nodes at\nroughly the same time, or some partitions will be overreplicated.\nThat's it! Once the data is ingested, you can query any node in the cluster for\nany key; peers will transparently proxy to eachother.\nNode Failure\nBy default, sequins has a sharding.replication setting of 2. That means that\nin the face of a single node going down, the cluster should still be able to\nrespond to all requests1.\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, sequins sharding is static; it will not\nautomatically correct the underreplication that results from a node\ndisappearing. If a node is permanently down, this can leave you in a precarious\nposition.\nSequins provides a mechanism to deal with this in the form of the\nshard_id configuration\nproperty. The shard_id, unlike hostname, does not have to be unique per node.\nIf you spin up a node with the same shard_id, it will replicate the exact same\npartitions. You can use this to replace an exploded node, or to spin up a new\nnode in advance of decommissioning an old one.\n\n1. Of course, it's still important for clients to retry requests (and have timeouts). ↩\n\nZookeeper Failure\nSequins depends on Zookeeper for the coordination of sharding, but only ever\nasynchronously. That means that if Zookeeper becomes unavailable,\n\nNew nodes will refuse to start up.\n\nSequins will not download new databases or versions of databases.\n\nIn the case of a split, where some nodes can talk to Zookeeper and others\ncan not, the partition map may become stale, and you may receive different\nversions of a given database from different nodes.\n\n\nCrucially, however, Zookeeper going down should never impact an existing\ncluster's ability to service requests.\nVersion upgrades\nSequins uses Zookeeper to check which nodes have which partitions. It will\nupgrade to a new version when that version is minimally replicated—when every\npartition is available somewhere in the cluster.\nNote that this occurs before the version is fully replicated, and\npossibly even before the local node has any partitions.\nReplication\nDuring the window between an upgrade and full replication, Sequins is\nmore vulnerable to node failure. You can mitigate this vulnerability by\nsetting sharding.min_replication, so that Sequins waits for a certain\namount of redundancy before triggering the upgrade.\nHowever, a high min_replication will also make upgrades take longer.\nIn particular, if min_replication is the same as replication, a\nsuccessful upgrade requires every single node to be up and running.\nRecommended settings for a stable cluster are therefore\n1 min_replication replication shard_id).\nVersion consistency\nNodes in a sequins cluster will make a best-effort attempt to upgrade a given\ndatabase at more or less the same time. It is, of course, physically impossible\nto ensure that individual nodes upgrade exactly at the same time, and you should\nnot rely on this property.\nIndividual nodes will also attempt to be individually consistent. If you query a\nnode in sequence, you should only ever see the version monotonically increase;\nin other words, once a node has upgraded to a new version of a given database,\nit should never return values from an older version, even if that request was\nproxied to another node. This, however, is also best-effort, and can fail in\nthe case of extended coordination failure (because of a Zookeeper outage or\nsomething else).\nIn these cases, Sequins will always optimize for availability, and choose to\nreturn a value from a different version if that is the only value available.\nSequins returns an X-Sequins-Version header on\nresponses if you\nneed to track what version you're getting.\n"},"1-5-healthchecks-and-monitoring/":{"url":"1-5-healthchecks-and-monitoring/","title":"Healthchecks and Monitoring","keywords":"","body":"Healthchecks and Monitoring\nThe Status Page and JSON\nVisiting the host and port that a sequins node is running on with your browser\nwill give you a simple status page with sharding and version information for\neach database:\n\nThe information presented represents the whole cluster in the distributed case,\nand should be the same no matter which node you ask.

For an overview of\nrunning a sequins cluster, including notes on how it should behave, see Running\nA Distributed Cluster.\nThe algorithm described here is effectively isolated between databases.\nTherefore, this document speaks to the operations on a single sequins database,\nrather than everything at once.\nDesign Principles\n\nSequins should be able to scale horizontally by just adding nodes to an\nexisting cluster. This should require as little shared state (in Zookeeper)\nas possible, and that shared state should be considered ephemeral.\nSpecifically, sequins should absolutely not require shared state in the read\npath; meaning that any node must be able to continue serving requests without\nany shared state available.\n\nTo minimize implementation complexity, sharding should be as static as\npossible. A cluster must reshard a database once at startup, and once\nwhenever a new version is available, but should not dynamically correct over-\nor underreplication.\n\nSince sequins is a more-or-less static, stateless store, and since writes are\nasync and affect the entire database at once, we don't have to think too hard\nabout consistency. But one important property to try to guarantee is\nmonotonic reads; if you talk to a single sequins instance during a version\nupgrade, you get only records from version (N-1) until the node upgrades, and\nthen only records from version N.\n\n\nShared State in Zookeeper\nZookeeper is used for shared state. To minimize complexity and stay robust to\nZookeeper failure, the code only supports two operations:\n\nPublishing ephemeral keys into a znode\nListing a znode's children and caching the state locally\n\nAll state must be considered possibly minutes, hours or years stale. All read\noperations read the cache; the syncing process happens separately.\nAll znodes described below are prefixed under a root which includes the cluster\nname and a protocol number\n(currently v1).\nProperties of a Version\nA version is an immutable map of keys to values, existing in the source root as\na collection of N files. Keys can be duplicated in the map, but only one value\nwill be loaded (which one is picked is undefined).\nIn addition, each version is sharded into N partitions. Each partition K\ncontains the keyspace where hashCode(key) % N == K.\nWe use Java's String hashCode algorithm as the hashing function, and the number of\nfiles as N, because that allows us to treat many datasets as pre-sharded by\nHadoop's shuffle step. In particular, any Hadoop job with the default\nPartitioner will produce a version where each file has the\nkeyspace of one and only one partition.\nHowever, this isn't a guarantee, so we treat this only as a possible\noptimization.\nUpgrades\nThis is the meatiest part of the distributed algorithm: how nodes discover and\nload new versions.\nOn startup (or when reconnecting to zookeeper), a node\n\nCreates an ephemeral znode under /nodes for itself\n\nStarts watching /nodes. On startup, it waits for these to remain stable\nfor some period before\ncontinuing.\n\n\nWhen it sees a new version (this also occurs at startup, and applies to both\nexisting and new databases), it\n\nWatches the children of partitions/, and continually mirrors that\nstate locally. This is the map of where partitions live on the cluster.\n\nWaits until every partition represented in the cluster at least once; in\nother words, until the minimum replication factor is at least\n1.\n\n\nIn the background, it decides which partitions it is responsible for and\nbackfills them. To do that, it\n\nDecides which partitions it is responsible for offline, by:\na. Creating an array of all partitions in sorted order * the replication\n   factor. (e.g. [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, ...])\nb. Creating an array of all nodes it knows about in sorted order based on\n   their shard id.\nc. For all of the partitions at index idx, if idx % len(nodes) is equal\n   to its position in the node array, we assign it that partition.\n\nStarts loading and preparing those partitions. As they become available, it\nwrites an ephemeral node to the partition map, at\n/partitions//@.\n\n\nNote that the ring is only used as a way to stably, fairly and deterministically\npick partitions without actually needing to read  current state of the cluster\n(which could be racy). Once the partition map is built, that is used as the\nactual state of the cluster going forward.\nOnce a node has the data locally, it can respond to peers that specifically ask\nthat version, but it won't upgrade to clients until it sees that a version is\ncomplete across the cluster. Note that this switch to clients, which is the\nactual upgrade, can happen before or after the local partitions are finished\nloading; it's decoupled from that process. This is important if, for example, a\nnode is starting up to join an existing cluster, and wants to be able to service\nrequests immediately.\nEven once it does upgrade (again, to clients), it keeps the old version around\nfor a period of time. Specifically, it starts a 10 minute timer, and every time\nit receives a request for the old version, it resets the timer. Only at the end\nof the timer does it clear the old version.\nThat means that a cluster effectively has two versions during an upgrade. In\nthis way, individual nodes can lag behind and still present a consistent picture\nto the clients they talk to.\nFinally, when responding to a request, the node\n\nLooks to see if it has the partition of the key locally. If so, it responds immediately\nIf not, determines a list of peers by consulting the cache of\n/partitions//\nPicks a node at random and tries it (?proxy=true is added to the\nquerystring to indicate that it shouldn't be proxied further).\nEvery duration of\nproxy_stage_timeout, it\nstarts a request to a new node in parallel.\nReturns the first request that succeeds, or bails after\nproxy_timeout.\n\n"},"x-1-configuration-reference/":{"url":"x-1-configuration-reference/","title":"1.

If you set this to 1, then\nloads will be completely serialized.\nthrottle_loads\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nunset (eg \"800μs\")\n\n\n\nIf this flag is set, sequins will sleep this long between writes while loading\ndata, artificially slowing down loads and reducing disk i/o. If you are using\ndisks where the latency is extremely sensitive to activity, then loading large\namounts of data can negatively impact your latency, and you may want to\nexperiment with this setting.\nrefresh_period\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nunset (eg \"10m\")\n\n\n\nIf this flag is set, sequins will periodically download new data this often. If\nyou enable this, you should also enable require_success_file, or sequins may\nstart automatically downloading a partially-created set of files.\nrequire_success_file\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nbool\nfalse\n\n\n\nIf this flag is set, sequins will only ingest data from directories that have a\n_SUCCESS file (which is produced by hadoop when it completes a job).\ncontent_type\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nunset (eg \"application/json\")\n\n\n\nIf this is set, sequins will set this Content-Type header on responses.\n[storage]\ncompression\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\"snappy\"\n\n\n\nThis can be either 'snappy' or 'none', and defines how data is compressed on\ndisk.\nblock_size\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nint\n4096\n\n\n\nThis controls the block size for on-disk compression.\n[s3]\nregion\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nunset (eg \"us-west-2\")\n\n\n\nThe S3 region for the bucket where your data is. If unset, and sequins is\nrunning on EC2, this will be set to the instance region.\naccess_key_id\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nsee below (eg \"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\")\n\n\n\nsecret_access_key\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nsee below (eg \"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\")\n\n\n\nThe access key and secret to use for S3. If unset, the env variables\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY will be used, or IAM instance\nrole credentials if they are available.\n[sharding]\nenabled\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nbool\nfalse\n\n\n\nIf true, sequins will attempt to connect to zookeeper at the specified addresses\n(see zk.servers), and coordinate with peer instances to shard datasets. For a\ncomplete description of the sharding algorithm, see the manual.\nreplication\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nint\n2\n\n\n\nThis is the number of replicas responsible for each partition.\nmin_replication\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nint\n1\n\n\n\nThis is the minimum number of replicas required for sequins to switch to\na new version. Set this to a higher value to ensure data redundancy before\nupgrading.\nYou probably don't want this to be equal to replication,\nor sequins will never upgrade versions if any node at all is down.\ntime_to_converge\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\"10s\"\n\n\n\nUpon startup, sequins will wait this long for the set of known peers to\nstabilize.\nproxy_timeout\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\"100ms\"\n\n\n\nThis is the total timeout (connect + request) for proxied requests to peers in a\nsequins cluster. You may want to increase this if you're running on particularly\ncold storage, or if there are other factors significantly increasing request\ntime.\nproxy_stage_timeout\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nsee below (eg \"50ms\")\n\n\n\nAfter this interval, sequins will try another peer concurrently with the first,\nas long as there are other peers available and the total time is less than\nproxy_timeout. If left unset, this defaults to the proxy_timeout divided by\nreplication_factor - enough time for all peers to be tried within the total\ntimeout.\ncluster_name\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\"sequins\"\n\n\n\nThis defines the root prefix to use for zookeeper state. If you are running\nmultiple sequins clusters using the same zookeeper for coordination, you should\nchange this so they can't conflict.\nadvertised_hostname\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nsee below (eg \"sequins1.example.com\")\n\n\n\nThis is the hostname sequins uses to advertise itself to peers in a cluster. It\nshould be resolvable by those peers. If left unset, it will be set to the\nhostname of the server.\nshard_id\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nsee below (eg \"sequins1\")\n\n\n\nThe shard ID is used to determine which partitions the node is responsible for.\nBy default, it is the same as advertised_hostname. Unlike the hostname,\nhowever, it doesn't have to be unique; two nodes can have the same shard_id, in\nwhich case they will download the same partitions. This can be useful if you\ndon't have stable hostnames, but want to be able to rebuild a server to take the\nplace of a dead or decomissioning one.\n[zk]\nservers\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\narray of string\n[\"localhost:2181\"]\n\n\n\nIf set and 'sharding.enabled' is true, sequins will connect to zookeeper at the\ngiven addresses.\nconnect_timeout\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\"1s\"\n\n\n\nThis specifies how long to wait while connecting to zookeeper.\nsession_timeout\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\"10s\"\n\n\n\nThis specifies the session timeout to use with zookeeper. The actual timeout is\nnegotiated between server and client, but will never be lower than this number.\n[datadog]\nurl\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\"localhost:8200\"\n\n\n\nIf set, sequins will send metrics concerning S3 file downloads using the\nDogStatsD protocol to this address.\n[debug]\nbind\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nstring\nunset (eg \"localhost:6060\")\n\n\n\nIf set, binds the golang debug http server, which can serve expvars and\nprofiling information, to the specified address.\nexpvars\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nbool\ntrue\n\n\n\nIf set, this adds expvars to the debug HTTP server, including the default ones\nand a few sequins-specific ones.\npprof\n\n\n\nType\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nbool\nfalse\n\n\n\nIf set, this adds the default pprof handlers to the debug HTTP server.\n"}}}
