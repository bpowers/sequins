Sequins is read-only key/value store designed for serving precomputed datasets
quickly and quietly. It emphasizes operational simplicity and robustness, and
offers easy horizontal scaling with sharding and replication.

We use sequins at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for a couple different use
cases. On SSDs, it works very well for serving tiny, hot aggregates very
quickly and reliably. We also use it to shard large, cold, immutable archived
data in situations where we know our access patterns ahead of time.
